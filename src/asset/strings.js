    "aboutme":"Trust me writing about yourself is one of the hardest things I have faced, my name is Beraki Befekadu, as you may have understood from the first line I am not one who knows how to explain things but let me try. <p/> I am a very passionate programmer, passionate because when I was just 8 years old one of my computer teachers showed me HTML and when I went back home I practiced it like hell, made a web page with a background-image and a background-sound (yes. background sound was cool) After that day, I said I want to do this forever. <p/>After many years when I was 15 years old, Facebook was getting famous, myspace was cool but I was left behind. Then it hit me again and I started to surf the internet looking for material to teach myself programming. I managed to learnt PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS. With the skills I gained I created my own social media called Enter. It took me 1 year and 6 months to put it together and then I knew it was too late to launch. But it didnâ€™t keep me from innovating new ideas. <p/>I was living in Uganda a very peaceful and green country in East Africa. But the internet was slow, and only a few people had access to it. So, I came up with an idea to create a Bulk SMS platform. And I built Lookoutsms an online website where you can buy credits and send SMS messages to invite people for a wedding party, a baptism or even just say hi. I put up this project within 2 months and 2 days, I launched my product and marketed it to the local internet cafes to use at a cost.<p/> I ran the website for 2 years with minimal cost and a good profit, however I knew it was not going to succeed as internet was being more useful and people were moving on to Facebook. So, I looked in to the future and there I saw Android Mobile Development.While I learnt, android mobile development, I started taking on Database management and custom content management system maintenance contracts. My clients would approach me with a problem and leave with a great solution to it. I now make android applications for fun and learn new technologies to grow my knowledge base.Well that will be all about me for now. Sounds like news haa.. :)"
